# Self-organized-criticality

The model of self-organized criticality by Levina et al (2007) is implemented in python, using the network simulator class brian2. You can find a step-by-step instruction in the Tutorials folder. Furthermore the file soc.py offers a method to easily simulate networks of self-organized criticality and to plot avalanche distributions from spike trains.
